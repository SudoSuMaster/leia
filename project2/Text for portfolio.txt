Toronto Cupcake
-
Context: During my first year in CMD, I redesigned the website for Toronto Cupcake, a cupcake shop in Toronto. Through a heuristic analysis, I identified non-user-friendly elements on the website and improved them through a redesign to enhance usability. My objective was to provide a better user experience for visitors to the website, enabling them to easily order cupcakes and find information about the assortment and the shop.

Kattencafe op zn kop
-
Context: During my second year in CMD, I conducted an in-depth study on usability, focusing on the Cat Café in Groningen. For this assignment, I developed three posters and a redesign. The posters encapsulate research methods and findings from usability tests employing techniques such as think-aloud protocols, eye tracking, and SUS (System Usability Scale) interviews. Utilizing these insights, I embarked on a redesign journey to create a more user-friendly version of the Cat Café website. The final poster presents a comparison between the original website and my redesigned version.

Scrollytelling Mario's Evolution
-
Context: In my first year of CMD, I created a scrollytelling website exploring the history of Mario's iconic video game franchise. This project allowed me to share Mario's journey in an engaging and easy-to-follow format. I covered various well-known Mario games, offering interesting facts and tapping into the nostalgia felt by many in the target audience. Using storytelling and scrolling techniques in Figma, I ensured a smooth flow between each game, making the experience seamless for the user.

The truman Show video

Context: One project I'm proud of is when I recreated 'The Truman Show' through video editing. I added my own unique style to it, focusing on making it visually interesting. By using smooth transitions and eye-catching visuals, I aimed to make Truman's journey feel more real and captivating. It was a fun challenge that allowed me to tell a story in a creative way that people could really connect with.

Mosaic
-
Context: Playing around with motion design in After Effects, I crafted a moving mosaic. By using shapes, masks, and keyframes, I made each part move together in harmony. It was a fun experiment in animation, exploring how everything could fit together seamlessly.


Waterflow
-
In a simple experiment using After Effects, I synced water ripples to one of my favorite songs, "Don't Panic" by Coldplay. It was a fun project exploring how visuals and music can complement each other. By carefully timing and arranging the ripples, I created a captivating visual display that matched the song's rhythm and mood, offering a mesmerizing audio-visual experience.
